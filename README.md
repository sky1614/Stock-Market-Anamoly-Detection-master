# Stock Market Anomaly Detection: GME Analysis

## Project Overview


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1b5c802-1635-44d7-b92c-d341fd908c91


This project focuses on detecting anomalies in the stock price data of GameStop (GME) using multiple machine learning techniques. We implement and compare various anomaly detection methods to identify unusual patterns or events in the stock's behavior, providing insights into market dynamics and potential trading opportunities.

## Features

- Data retrieval using yfinance
- Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of multiple anomaly detection techniques:
  - Z-Score
  - Isolation Forest
  - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks
  - Autoencoder
- Performance comparison of different methods
- Interactive Streamlit app for result visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-anomaly-detection.git
   cd stock-anomaly-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Stock_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb
   ```

2. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `Stock_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- `app.py`: Streamlit app for interactive visualization
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
- `data/`: Directory for storing downloaded stock data (if applicable)
- `models/`: Directory for saving trained models (if applicable)

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve GME stock data using yfinance library.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean data, handle missing values, and calculate additional features (e.g., returns, volatility).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize stock price trends, volume, returns, and volatility.
4. **Anomaly Detection Methods**:
   - Z-Score: Identify outliers based on standard deviations from the mean.
   - Isolation Forest: Detect anomalies using isolation in the feature space.
   - DBSCAN: Cluster data points and identify outliers.
   - LSTM: Predict stock prices and flag significant deviations as anomalies.
   - Autoencoder: Learn normal patterns and detect anomalies based on reconstruction error.
5. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate and compare the performance of each method using precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Visualization**: Create interactive plots to display detected anomalies and compare results.

## Results

The project provides insights into:
- Periods of unusual activity in GME stock
- Effectiveness of different anomaly detection techniques for stock market data
- Comparative analysis of model performances

Detailed results and visualizations are available in the Jupyter notebook and Streamlit app.

## Streamlit App Features

The Streamlit app offers an interactive interface for exploring the anomaly detection results:

- Stock data input and date range selection
- Interactive EDA visualizations
- Individual plots for each anomaly detection method
- Combined visualization of all methods' results
- Performance metrics comparison
- Summary statistics of detected anomalies

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional features (e.g., sentiment analysis, market indicators)
- Experiment with ensemble methods for improved anomaly detection
- Extend the analysis to other stocks or financial instruments
- Implement real-time anomaly detection for live stock data
